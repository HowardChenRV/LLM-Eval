                "prompt": "Could you please provide a concise and comprehensive summary of the given text?\n---\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated that innovation and innovation policy can be crucial components of governments’ responses to crises. It has also brought into focus that crisis innovation problems raise different questions for science and technology (S&T) policy, and may require different tools, than non-crisis times. Though crisis innovation policy was not a major feature of the U.S. innovation policy dialogue immediately before COVID, it has been a prevailing theme of the past year. It also a long and storied history: the most famous earlier response—indeed one appealed to by many in the COVID-19 pandemic—was the U.S. World War II research effort. Led by the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), under the direction of Vannevar Bush, the wartime effort helped develop, test, and get into practice numerous technologies and medical treatments that were essential to the Allied victory, including radar, mass-produced penicillin, the proximity fuze, malaria treatment, and the atomic bomb. The wartime R&D experience also led to long-run changes in the U.S. innovation system and postwar innovation policy.\nIn this paper, we survey the efforts undertaken in World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic and consider implications for innovation policy in crisis and regular times. We begin with the premise that crises can put unique demands on the innovation system which may require a distinct response (Gross and Sampat 2021). Whether a given problem or situation rises to the level of a ‘crisis’ can often be subjective, but in our view, what makes a crisis problems distinctive is that they are urgent, high-stakes, and often unanticipated. In a crisis, losses can accumulate quickly or spiral out of control if a problem is not quickly contained, and once it does, a crisis may require a focused innovation effort to resolve, like developing new weapons or vaccines. We believe the responses to these two crises can offer lessons in method and contrast. Our goal for this chapter is to summarize what each of these efforts comprised, draw comparisons, identify key policy tradeoffs, and provide insight on the short- and long-run effects of crisis innovation.\nWe begin in Section 1 by examining the World War II response to distill the main elements of the wartime model of crisis innovation policy and the high-level questions it needed to consider. The OSRD model, while specific to its time, was also by most accounts successful, and the experience is cited as precedent for a wide range of crisis innovation activities. In Section 2, we then discuss the evolution of the postwar innovation system and how policy was shaped by World War II, traversing and summarizing 75 years of science policy from the end of the war to the dawn of the pandemic. This evolution would in turn mean that the COVID-19 crisis confronted a very different innovation system than existed in 1940.\nAs of the time of this writing, it is challenging to fully evaluate the COVID-19 model, as we are still in midst  of the crisis and the crisis response. Moreover, we lack for COVID-19 the types of data, correspondence, and other records available to study the World War  II period.  In Section  3 we  nevertheless attempt to describe  the COVID-19 innovation response based on currently available information, anticipating that more will be written when the full story can be told. We then discuss how the COVID response seems similar to and different from the World War II model, and how that may reflect broader differences in today’s innovation system and the different nature of the central innovation policy problem.\nIn Section 4, we use the two episodes to identify key tradeoffs in crisis innovation policy, discuss how they manifested in each crisis, and suggest what factors may influence policy choices. We focus on four tensions: \ntop-down vs. bottom-up priority setting, concentrated vs. distributed funding, patent policy, and managing disruptions to the innovation system. Though several of these tensions are endemic to S&T policy even in ordinary times, we argue they can be particularly acute in a crisis.\nIn Section 5 we then use the World War II experience to survey the short- and long-run effects of crisis innovation. Beyond impacts on the crisis at hand, these include effects on the rate and direction of innovation, effects on R&D-intensive firms and industries, effects on scientific careers, and effects on science policy. In Section 6 we put the collective evidence into perspective and consider some ways in which the COVID-19 R&D effort might also have long-lived impacts on U.S. innovation and innovation policy. While we will have to wait for the post-pandemic future to unfold, if the past is any guide, more changes may yet be in store for the U.S. and global innovation system in the years ahead\nWorld War II began in September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland; the United Kingdom, France, and several other countries declared war on Germany; and Russia counter-invaded Poland two weeks later. Two months later Russia invaded Finland, and four months after that Germany controlled Denmark and Norway. In early May 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France, and on June 14, Paris fell to Germany, with France formally surrendering on June 22.\nAmericans could observe this conflagration from a distance, as the U.S. was not at immediate risk of being invaded. But the fall of France broke the general sense of complacency and made clear to many U.S. leaders that the country would be drawn in: for the U.S., the war in Europe was a crisis in the making. It was also on June 14 that a small group of scientists and science administrators, led by  Vannevar  Bush (President  of the Carnegie Institute of Washington and former Vice President and Dean of Engineering at MIT), met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt to express concerns that the U.S. was “unprepared to fight a modern war” (Stewart 1948) and propose that he put civilian scientists to work on developing military technology. On June 27, 1940, Roosevelt formally created the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) for this end. The U.S. would not formally enter the war until December 8, 1941.\nThe NDRC was led by Bush as its Chair, supported by Karl Compton (President of MIT), James Conant (President of Harvard), and Frank Jewett (President of the National Academy of Sciences and of Bell Labs), Richard Tolman (CalTech physicist), Conway Coe (the U.S. Patent Commissioner), and one representative  from each of the Army and the Navy, who together comprised “the Committee”. Funded by the President’s discretionary budget, NDRC’s mandate was to “coordinate, supervise, and conduct scientific research on the problems underlying the development, production, and use of mechanisms and devices of warfare.”  To  do  so, it was authorized to perform research directly as well as to contract for extramural research. NDRC’s  work was to supplement that of other agencies, including the military.\n NDRC began with an ambitious mission but only eight staff (the members themselves) and no precedent to follow. At its first meeting, the committee organized into five divisions by subject (Table 1) and concurrently began recruiting other top scientists to fill the new agency’s ranks.  It also decided that it would contract     out research rather than perform it directly—a radical move for its time.\nImpressed by a string of early accomplishments, on June 28, 1941 President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8807 creating OSRD. The new organization, to be led by Bush, addressed several deficiencies in the original structure (including expanding its scope to medical research), and would be the principal agency organizing civilian science and technology for war. Now funded by Congressional appropriations, OSRD subsumed NDRC (now chaired by Conant) and added a Committee on Medical Research (CMR) (chaired by A. N. Richards, a pharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania). The scope of crisis activities that OSRD engaged in was broader than research alone. In addition to NDRC and CMR, the OSRD included an Advisory Council, which coordinated research activities across the government. It later added an Office of Field Service (to deploy scientists to the field, where they would study field problems and aid in training and use of OSRD devices in combat operations), a Liaison office (for sharing and coordinating research with Allied countries, including via foreign branches), a Scientific Personnel office (to manage personnel shared by the OSRD and other agencies, and to handle draft deferments for technical staff at OSRD and its contractors), and an Administrative office (for contract management).\nBoth NDRC and CMR were organized into divisions by subject matter led by scientific experts. NDRC’s structure expanded significantly as the scope of its work grew,  and by  the end of the war it had grown to      26 divisions (Table 2). The largest were Radar and Rocket Ordnance, which primarily funded large, central  labs (the MIT Radiation Laboratory (“Rad Lab”) and the CalTech  Jet Propulsion Lab, which were created  or significantly expanded to meet the needs of the war effort).\nDespite having just one-tenth of NDRC’s budget, CMR was also essential to the wartime effort.  Its mandate was to mobilize medical researchers and identify “the need for and character of contracts to be entered into with universities, hospitals, and other agencies conducting medical research activities.” Funding of extra- mural medical research was also new: one of the leaders of the effort (Chester Keefer, the “penicillin czar”) later characterized CMR as “a novel experiment in American medicine” noting “planned and coordinated medical research had never been essayed on such a scale” (Keefer 1969).\nOSRD’s annual budget grew from $6.2 million in 1940-1 to $160-170 million in 1944 and 1945. By the end of the war, OSRD had spent over $536 million on R&D, across over 2,500 contracts, including 1,500 contracts by NDRC, 570 by CMR, and about 100 for research on atomic fission, before this work was spun out into the Manhattan Project, as we describe below. It also grew to be a large organization, at its peak employing nearly 1,500 personnel across multiple locations (Stewart 1948).\nIn the space of five years, this effort produced major developments in a wide range of technologies. Figure 1 illustrates the focus of OSRD’s work, using words in the titles of OSRD patents and publications. NDRC was responsible for many of the most notable technological developments of the war, including radar, electronic communication (including early computing), underwater detection (sonar), rockets and jet propulsion, and atomic fission,  among others.   CMR’s work helped support the mass production of penicillin;  influenza   and other vaccines;  new malaria treatments;  new approaches to managing wartime hardships such as sleep  and oxygen deprivation,  cold temperatures,  nutrient deficiencies,  and psychological stress;  and techniques  for treating injuries  and wounds.  Beyond its  immediate  impacts  on the  war and on science,  the  OSRD  also created the template for federal R&D procurement, laid the foundation for postwar S&T policy, and reshaped the postwar innovation system, as we will discuss below.The war posed a challenge to the budding U.S. innovation system: develop a range of new technologies, produce them at scale, and get them deployed quickly enough to deliver an Allied victory. As Conant wrote, “The basic problem of mobilizing science during World War II was [one] of setting up rapidly an organization or organizations which would connect effectively the laboratory, the pilot plant, and the factory with each other and with the battlefront” (Conant 1947). Bush likewise wrote, “It was the function of [OSRD] to channelize and focus an amazing array of variegated activities, to co-ordinate them both with the military necessities which they were designed to help to meet and with the requirements of the powerful industrial structure on which their effective application relied” (Bush 1970).Applied focus, top-down priority setting\nOSRD led a primarily applied research effort.1 Executive Order 8807 explicitly tasked it with the following duties, which leave no ambiguity about the purpose of its work (emphasis added):\n• Advise the President with regard to ... scientific and medical research relating to national defense.\n• Serve as the center for mobilization of the scientific personnel and resources ... to defense purposes.\n• Co-ordinate, aid, and, where desirable, supplement ... research activities relating to national defense\ncarried on by the Departments of War and Navy and other ... agencies of the Federal Government.\n• Develop broad and co-ordinated plans for the conduct of scientific research in the defense program.\n• Initiate and support scientific research on [instruments] of warfare ... required for national defense.\n• Initiate and support scientific research on medical problems affecting the national defense.\n• Initiate and support such scientific and medical research as may be requested by the government of any country whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States.\nIts priorities were thus defined by military need, and the urgency of the crisis meant that it mostly had to take basic science as given. As we explain below, this approach is a contrast to many postwar R&D funding institutions, where research is investigator-initiated, often fundamental, and scientists have a larger role in shaping the agenda. At NDRC it was ultimately divisions, and within them individual study sections, which identified research priorities, organized proposals, and made arrangements with contractors.\nEngaging top R&D performers\nA second feature of the wartime effort was its focus on funding top institutions and researchers. To support this activity, one of NDRC’s first undertakings in 1940 was to build a roster of potential contractors by subject area, which became a standard reference for placing contracts. It prioritized getting results quickly over distributional concerns, favoring contractors “with the facilities and the manpower which promised the best results in the shortest possible time” (Stewart 1948).\nIncentives and the contract mechanism\nThe decision to outsource research, rather than perform it directly, was novel. To do so, OSRD invented the federal R&D contract, which balanced specificity with flexibility to explore. The language was standardized but negotiable, and contractors “almost invariably started work under letters of intent which preceded the signing of contracts by weeks or months” (Stewart 1948), so as to not delay progress. Though contracts were written for short (e.g., 6-month) periods, there was an “informal understanding that they would be extended if the progress of the work warranted.”"

In addition, GDP is the only indicator to assess the economy, and GDP is strongly respected, ignoring other aspects of social and economic development. In many places, economic growth is still at the expense of theenvironment and resources, and the importance of sustainable development is not attached importance.

Researchers have suggested that the most prominent, but not the only, acoustical parameters of speech when it is produced to express different emotions are related to the F0, namely its mean, minimum, maximum, and range (e.g., Bänziger & Scherer, 2005; Breitenstein, Van Lancker, Daum, & Waters, 2001; Busson, Bulut, Lee, & Narayanan, 2009; Ross et al., 2001). Banse and Scherer (1996) and Frick (1985) have suggested that F0 and temporal parameters have the strongest influence on differentiating between different emotions. Utterance duration has been identified as an important parameter for cueing specific emotions (Vroomen, Collier, & Mozziconacci, 1993). Indeed, when the F0 and duration parameters of specific emotions were copied onto monotonous speech, recognition rates for the emotions were copied onto monotonous speech, recognition rates for the emotions were as high as 81%, suggesting that these cues are extremely important for cueing the particular emotions (Vroomen et al., 1993). Szameitat and colleagues (2009) have also identified intensity as an important cue to emotion in speech and music. \nAcoustical parameter profiles of specific emotions.\n Four of the emotions which will be used to record the stimuli used in this thesis, specifically angry, fearful, happy, and sad, have been used in numerous previous investigations into the production and perception of emotional speech. As such, the acoustical parameters specific to portrayals of these emotions have been well-documented. It should be noted that the research on portrayals of surprise, disgust, and neutral emotions is more limited. While there has been some variability in the acoustical parameters measured by previous researchers, most of the investigations have focused on voice F0 and temporal parameters, as these are thought to have the strongest effects on listeners’ accuracy in differentiating between emotions (Banse & Scherer, 1996; Breitenstein, Van Lancker, & Daum, 2001; Russell, Bachorowski, & Fernández-Dols, 2003). Indeed, in seminal papers in this area (e.g., Johnstone & Scherer, 2000; Murray & Arnott, 1993; Pittam & Scherer, 1993; Scherer, 2003), emotions are commonly described based on mean and range of F0, mean and range of intensity and mean duration. It is important to note that the acoustical parameters of emotions have been described by a number of researchers in comparison to a neutral voice (Mozziconacci, 2002; Murray & Arnott, 1993). In the next section a description of findings will be provided for each of the emotions portrayed to create the set of stimuli, namely anger, disgust, fear, happiness, surprise, sadness, and neutral (see Chapter 3). \nFew researchers have examined the acoustical parameters of neutral speech. Barrett & Paus (2002) found that neutral stimuli had higher F0 values than sad stimuli. Portrayals of sad affective prosody are characterized by decreases in mean F0, F0 range, and mean intensity. Portrayals of anger, fear, and happiness have been shown to be quite similar to each other. Anger is typically portrayed through increases in mean F0, F0 variability, and F0 range, as well as increases in mean intensity, and mean duration. Similarly, fear is portrayed through increases in mean F0 and intensity and reduced duration. Mean F0 range during portrayals of fearful affective prosody has been shown to both increase (e.g., Johnstone & Scherer, 2000) and decrease (e.g., Banse & Scherer, 1996). Breitenstein et al. (2001) posit that mean F0 and speech rate are highest for emotions associated with high sympathetic arousal, for example, anger and fear. Happy is one of the few positive emotions to have been studied (Banse & Scherer, 1996), and it is portrayed through increases in mean F0, F0 range, and F0 variability. Research on portrayals of disgust is inconsistent, which may help to explain why recognition accuracy for this emotion is typically so low (Johnstone & Scherer, 2000). In comparison to angry affective prosody, stimuli spoken with a disgusted voice have lower intensity and mean F0 (Hammerschmidt & Jürgens, 2007). Compared to neutral, disgust is portrayed through a low mean F0, low intensity, and a slower speech rate (Schuller, Rigoll, & Lang, 2004). "

After him, the Archbishop of York is called the Primate of England and under these two archbishops come a number of bishops. England is divided into forty-two districts called dioceses, each with a bishop in charge and a cathedral as the central church. A diocese is divided into smaller districts called parishes. These vary in size, a large town having a number of parishes and a village being a single parish. Each parish is in the care of a priest, who is called either a vicar or a rector. A vicar with a large parish may have an assistant priest called a curate to help him.\nThe Church of England (or the Anglican Church) is the national church in England. The Church of England, and the monarch's relation to it, was established through a series of Parliamentary acts in the 1530s, which brought about the English Reformation. Henry Ⅷ broke from the Roman Catholic Church by denying papal claims to ecclesiastical or any other jurisdiction, and by declaring himself rather than the Pope as Supreme Head of the Church in England. The Preface to the 39 Articles of the Church of England describes the monarch as 'being by God's Ordinance, according to our just Title, Defender of the Faith and ... Supreme Governor of the Church of England.' The Monarch must be in communion with the Church of England (i.e. a full, confirmed member) and, in his or her coronation oath, the monarch promises to maintain the Church.\nThere are many examples of the relationship between the established Church and the State. Archbishops and bishops are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister, who considers the names selected by a Church Commission. They take an oath of allegiance to the Queen on appointment and may not resign without royal authority. The connection between Church and State is also symbolized by the fact that the Lords Spiritual (consisting of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and 24 diocesan bishops) sit in the House of Lords. Parish priests also take an oath of allegiance to the Queen.\nThe General Synod (including the bishops, elected representatives from the clergy and the laity) is the supreme authority of the Church of England.
